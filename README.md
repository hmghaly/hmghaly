- Hi! I'm a full-stack AI developer. I do full-stack (Frontend: Javascript/JQuery; Backend: Python/PHP - MySQL, SQLite, Shelves, flat files), and I also build ML/DL models for AI applications (using mainly PyTorch and sklearn). I design and implement web-based data collection workflows, to build web interfaces to collect data and annotations from humans, and train ML models with these. Using these models and interfaces, I build web-based AI applications to recognize and classify new data entered by users. I did this as part of my PhD dissertation. You may also check my new project on Arabic Alphabet Recognition here.
